* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - A better Spotlight with custom workflows (go to a specific Slack channel, open a Github repo in the default browser, etc.)

* [Annotate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/annotate-capture-and-share/id918207447?mt=12) - Capture a screenshot, quickly annotate, and then put it wherever you need (clipboard, drag and drop, save to disk, upload)

## setup

* show dotfiles in finder - (in terminal) `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`
